Ruby Bundler Example
--------------------

This is one of my favorite examples. It uses a plugin that has the ability to
run Ruby's Bundler installs. It also places any ruby bin scripts into the
virtualenv's ``bin`` directory. In this example, SASS and Compass are
installed. When you source the quickactivate file you can run sass and compass
from right within your virtual environment. Give it a shot!

Version 0.3.3 or greater is required for this example.

To run just do::
    
    $ vstrap init

Have fun!
