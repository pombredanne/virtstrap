Basic Example
-------------

Another simple example. It has a simple VEfile which defines arbitrary
environment variables. These variables are set to the desired values when the
virtual environment is activated and they are disabled when the environment is
deactivated.

Version 0.3.4 or greater is required for this example to work.

To run just do::
    
    $ vstrap init

Have fun!
